                    organizations have adopted to help employees manage their
                    dual work and nonwork obligations and some of the key

                    \textcite{9.51:1} explored how work obligations can
                    increase stress or enhance fulfillment at home,
                    \citeauthor{9.51:2} viewed work demands as raising family
                    stress, with potential negative consequences on work
                    performance. Results supported a model in which direct
                    effects of work demands and spillover effects of work
                    demands to work-to-family conflict led to a lower job
                    satisfaction and affective commitment, as well as
                    crossover effects of work-to-family conflict, spousal
                    stress transmission, and later family-to-work conflict on
                    organizational citizenship and absenteeism. Overall, the
                    study demonstrated a link from work demands to work
                    outcomes when considering the family, but those paths
                    differed depending on whether attitudinal or behavioural
                    work outcomes were examined.}
